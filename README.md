This Goodreads Quote Scraper is originally by @soniajoseph. Updated in 2022 by Eric Rosenberg @NarrowBridgeMedia.

This Python quote scraper gets the quote text, title, and author. If you enter the author name, the scraper will find and save the quotes to a database in the same directory.

The updated version in 2022 was optimized for and tested on Raspberry Pi, though it should work anywhere Python3, SQLite3, and BeautifulSoup are present.
